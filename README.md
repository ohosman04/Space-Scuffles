Hello, this is Omar! 

This game is my first on Pygame, I do hope you enjoy it! There are some points I'd like to briefly discuss before you proceed to try it, so please bare with me here!


Controls:
  1- Confrontation: For the first game-mode, the Yellow ship moves with WASD and shoots with the LCTRL respectively, whereas the Red ship moves with the arrow keys and shoots with the RCTRL.
  
  2- Survivor: For the second game-mode, one player commands the ship with WASD and cannot shoot. Their goal is to get as much eggs before they run out of health. The other player simply has to press SPACE to shoot bullets and hope to catch the survivor off guard before they score a bunch of points!
  
  
  
Thank you for reading this, and enjoy the game! :)
